# General Proofs
##### Proof By Definition
- Meant for simple proofs, uses and explaisn the given problem and expands on how it is true
##### Proof By Contradiction
Initial Statement$$ p \implies q $$
Contradiction of Initial Statement$$p \implies \lnot q $$
For example, the statement: if it rains then the ground is wet
- The contradiction of this statement would be...
		if it rains then the ground is not wet
- When we prove by contradiction we prove that the statement is false by assuming it is true
# Sets
##### Double Subset Inclusion
$$ A\subseteq B \cap B\subseteq A \implies A = B$$
- Any time you need to prove that two sets are equal, use this
# Logic
##### Direct Proof
- Convert to logical expression, then assume the initial statement is true and use mathematical reasoning to prove the conclusion.
- For example, prove that if the sum of two numbers are even, prove that their difference is even.
$$
\begin{gather*}
\text{If the statement is true, then we can express this as,} \\
{a + b = 2n \implies 2(a-b)} \\
\text{Where n is any real number}
\end{gather*}
